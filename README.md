# Q_band_ZB
Compute the electronic band structure of Zinc Blende semiconductors.

3 models are available and can be switched ON/OFF:

-> Empirical Pseudo-potential Method (EPM)

-> Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) or Tight Binding (sp3s*)

-> k.p 8band, using the Dresselhaus, Kip and Kittel (DKK) notation and the Luttinger parameters (EP, F, g1, g2, g3)
